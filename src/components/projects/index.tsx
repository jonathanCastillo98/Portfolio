                            <p className='uchi__description'>I worked at Uchiyama Manufacturing de Yucat√°n (a Japanese enterprise) from 2020 - 2022, where I was part of the initial team of the plant conformed of almost only 10 people. During the first months, I spent time learning about the processes that were going to be part of the production process, then I was assigned as the Processing Material Head, where my main goal was to make everything as perfect as possible in that area in order for the plant to start the production process as fast as possible.
                                <br /> <br /> After almost a year of learning about my job position and a new culture, I was assigned people (Engineers and Operators) to train them in order to start the production process, the thing that happened a few months later without any problem.
